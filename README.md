# Pomodoro
Keeps track of the amount of time the user has worked<br><br>
Notifies the user if they would like to begin working. <br>
If the user agrees to start work a 25 minute timer is set.<br>
Once the user works for 25 minutes a notification arises to take a break for 5 minutes.<br>
If the user works four 25 minute increments they are rewarded a 30 minute break<br>

## Usage
This project creation was based off of the pomodoro technique
the goal was to create a program that will electronically keep track of how long I have studied for.
I still currently use this so i can keep track of my productivity and know when its time for a break.
